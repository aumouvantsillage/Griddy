This is a simple add-on that provides a grid view for your Songbird library.

The media page shows the album grid at the top, and the ordinary Songbird media list at the bottom.
Clicking on an album cover selects the first track of the corresponding album; double-clicking starts playing it.
When the search field is used, the contents of the grid are automatically updated to show only the matching albums.

This add-on was written as a mean for the author to learn XUL and other Mozilla technologies:
users should consider it as alpha quality; developers are welcome to criticize and help.
